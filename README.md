## UX

#### Multiple Page Application (MPA)

- An MPA felt appropiate; reason being the navigation flow of a multi-page site is easy to follow. This type of website has been around since the 90s, which means that most users are familiar with it, and often expect to find multiple pages on sites. The website’s navigation flow is easy to follow, making easy usability with this multi-page design.

- The contains a small amount of content, so the minimal MPA design lends well to serving an clear informational purpose, in this case, a micro-site for airgun products and events.
 
#### Colour Scheme

- The generation of a bespoke colour was accomplished by blending RGB and Hex colours to those of a video background via the use of HTML & CSS.

  - ![#444444](https://placehold.it/15/444444/000000?text=+) `#444444` Very dark gray

  - ![#222222](https://placehold.it/15/222222/000000?text=+) `#222222` Very dark gray (mostly black).

  - ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff` White

I tested the application using `Google Chrome Dev tools` for various devices sizes to see if the application responsiveness scaled correctly in size.

The devices was also test on real-world mobile devices (personal phone and tablet).

- External links to third party websites.

- All buttons sizes were checked for responsiveness.

- Ensured individual section headers resized and appeared well when viewed on various device screens.

- Spell checked all text content.

- HTML and CSS validation via [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/ "W3C Official Site").

- Checked margins and padding of the container (sections) to ensure the content within it did not look disproportionate on various screen sizes, individually smaller devices.

## Deployment
