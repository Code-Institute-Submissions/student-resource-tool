The devices was also test on real-world mobile devices (personal phone and tablet).

- External links to third party websites.

- All buttons sizes were checked for responsiveness.

- Ensured individual section headers resized and appeared well when viewed on various device screens.

- Spell checked all text content.

- HTML and CSS validation via [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/ "W3C Official Site").

- Checked margins and padding of the container (sections) to ensure the content within it did not look disproportionate on various screen sizes, individually smaller devices.
